The dataset that I have selected is [NFL scoring data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tobycrabtree/nfl-scores-and-betting-data?select=spreadspoke_scores.csv)
 This dataset is a compilation of NFL game data including the final score as well as the betting favorite and the betting odds. This data can be useful for analyzing the sports betting market and can be used to find advantages in the sports betting world. 

[GGPlot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis](https://ggplot2-book.org/) is a book about the ggplot2 library in R. The book is written by Hadley Wickham, Danielle Navarro, and Thomas Lin Pedersen and is published by Springer Publishing. GGPlot2 is a graphics library that allows for powerful visualizations through R. I chose this book because I often encounter plots in R that were made with GGPlot2 and I thought that it would be a good library to highlight.
